# DSportfolio# Data Visualization Portfolio


Welcome! I'm Nafisul Hasan Sami — a Math and Art major passionate about exploring how creativity and technology intersect to drive innovation.


At the crossroads of creativity and technology, I’m a Math and Art major passionate about exploring how these worlds intersect to drive innovation. Mathematics sharpens my analytical thinking, while my lifelong love for art fuels my creativity, whether I’m designing digital artwork, diving into programming, or strategizing in a competitive game. Curiosity, adaptability, and a sense of humor are at the core of who I am. I approach challenges with precision and creativity, finding unique solutions and enjoying the process along the way. My interests span the impact of technology on art, the strategic depth of gaming, and the power of humor to connect with others. I believe that meaningful work comes from blending intellect, creativity, and human connection. With these values in mind, I’m excited to continue learning, innovating, and shaping a future where art and technology come together to inspire.


Welcome to my data visualization portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis and visualization. I am passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and compelling visuals.

## Project 1: Recreate & Remix


## 🎭 Project 1: Gender Wage Trends in Art Professions (2014–2022)


![Preview of Gender Wage Remix](Images/Pic1.jpg)
*Grouped bar chart showing gender wage trends in art professions*


**Goal:** Explore wage trends among male and female professionals in art-related fields over time and highlight the gender wage gap more clearly. 
**Motivation:** The original line chart (from DataUSA) effectively displayed trends but did not emphasize the wage disparity between genders. This project remixes the visualization to offer clearer comparisons. 
**Tools:** Python, Plotly, Canva


---


### 🔁 Remix Summary


I transformed the original line graph into a grouped bar chart to improve clarity in year-by-year wage comparisons. This format allows viewers to immediately grasp differences in wages between men and women in artistic occupations.


---


### 🎨 Design Decisions


- **Chart Type:** Converted from a line graph to a grouped bar chart 
- **Color Scheme:** Maintained original colors for gender — blue (#122D58) for males, red (#CA3433) for females 
- **Background & Aesthetics:** Preserved the original background color (#E4E8F3) and overall visual structure 
- **Axis Formatting:** Applied currency formatting to improve readability 
- **Legend & Layout:** Retained familiar placements and grid for viewer continuity

## 🖼️ Project 2: Women Artists Remain Underrepresented in the Art World


![Preview of Women Artists Infographic](assets/women_artists_preview.png) 
*Infographic highlighting gender disparities in art education, museum collections, and the art market*


**Goal:** Use visual storytelling to highlight how women, despite being the majority of art school graduates, remain drastically underrepresented in museum collections, exhibitions, and the art market. 
**Motivation:** This project addresses a persistent gender gap in the art world using data-driven design and compelling visual contrasts. 
**Tools:** Canva, Illustrator, Python (data prep), Research Synthesis


---


### 📊 Project Summary


The infographic is organized into four panels:


1. **Introduction – A Dramatic Contrast:** 
  Introduces the disparity — women earn ~70% of fine arts degrees but are only ~13% of museum collections.
2. **By the Numbers – The Gender Gap:** 
  Shows the wide gender gap across museum collections, gallery representation, exhibitions, and market sales.
3. **Spotlight on Progress – Signs of Change:** 
  Highlights positive institutional efforts, exhibitions achieving parity, and leadership shifts.
4. **Call to Action – Balancing the Scales:** 
  Encourages viewers to support equity by promoting women artists and holding institutions accountable.
